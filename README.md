# DataStructure_Lists
I defined my own data type LNear (which is a Doubly linked list) with NodeL (nodes)
  
The program has been developed on Windows using MSYS2 and MinGW and can be run with this environment or with the command "ejecutable.exe" using a cmd, It only prints some tests to make sure the app works as expected.

The app represents one or more maps (class "Coleccion.cc") with sea "M" and ground where can be towns "T", reading from a file the data
For example the .txt:
```
MMMMM
MTTTM
MMMMM
<LOCALIDAD>
Alicante
1 1
<INFO>
hotel 2
restaurante 1
```
has a town called Alicante on (1,1) with 2 hotels and a restaurant
